Description:
    Generator for setting up another database in Rails
    Just What We were missing

Example:
    rails g database NAME adapter:adapter_name db:database_name login:username psswd:password host:host_name port:port_number

    NAME 
      name your database here (also applies on directory names and so on ...)

    adapter
      for now it supports:
        * MySQL (as 'mysql')
        * PostgreSQL (as 'pg')
        * SQLite (as 'sqlite')

    db  
      you can change the name of your database othervise it falls back to the NAME of your db (in most cases leave blank :) )

    login
      except sqlite, you can specify your DB credentials (this one stand for username)

    psswd
      except sqlite, you can specify your DB credentials (this one stands for password)

    host
      except sqlite, you can specify your DB credentials (this one stands for host, in most cases localhost)

    port
      except sqlite, you can specify your DB credentials (this one stands for port, in case of postgresql 5432)
  

    This will create:
      config      config/database_store.yml
      directory   db_store
      file        db_store/.keep
      directory   db_store/migrate
      file        db_store/migrate/.keep
      directory   app/models/store
      seeds       db_store/seeds.rb
      rake_task   lib/tasks/database_store.rake
      base_model  app/models/store/base.rb
